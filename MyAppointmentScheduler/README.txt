Appointment Scheduler Version 1
Used to schedule appointments with a contact and customer associated with each appointment.

1. Upon launching program you will be prompted with a login screen, login with correct credentials.

2. After login you will be seeing the Main menu which houses an appointment table where you can view all appointments or view appointments by either week or month.

3. You have the options to either add, update or delete appointments.

---Delete--- will simple delete the selected appointment and refresh the table to display remaining appointments.

---Add---    will take you to a form where you are prompted to enter the details for your new appointment.

---Update--- will take you to a form where all the details of the selected appointment will be displayed and you are free to change any values as long as it is inside business hours and it does not overlap with another appointment.

4. There is also a button at the top labeled "Customers", clicking this will take you to the customer table where you can view all customers and their corresponding data. Again you will have the option to either add, delete or update a customer. It works the same way as appointments except there is no restrictions on updating or adding and you can only delete a customer if that customer does not have an associated appointment.

5. On the main menu there is also a button to view reports, the report page will have a table where you can select a contact and that contacts schedule will be displayed. You can also view the total number of appointments for a given monrth or appointment type. 

There is also a report stating how many of the scheduled appointments fall on a weekend.
